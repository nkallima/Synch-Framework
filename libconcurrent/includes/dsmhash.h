/// @file dsmhash.h
/// @brief This file exposes the API of the DSM-Hash concurrent hash-table implementation based on the DSM-Synch combining technique [1].
///
/// This hash-table implementation uses an array of a fixed amount of cells that it is defined during the initialization of the data-structure. 
/// Each cell contains at most one <key,value> pair and a pointer to a next cell. For handling collisions this hash-table uses separate chaining.
/// For each cell there is a single instance of DSM-Synch. Whenever a thread wants to search, insert or delete a <key,value> pair in a
/// specific cell, it should use the corresponding DSM-Synch instance. Since this hash-table implementation is not expandable 
/// (the initial size of the array is fixed), it may become very slow in cases of storing big amounts of <key,value> pairs.
/// An example of use of this API is provided in benchmarks/dsmhashbench.c file.

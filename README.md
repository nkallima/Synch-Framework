# Summary

This is a collection of optimized concurrent shared data structures which are based on Sim universal
construction algorithm. Current version of the code is optimized for x86_64 machine architectures. 
Some of the benchmarks run much better in machine architectures that natively support Fetch&Add
instructions(e.g., x86_64, etc.).

However, some of the benchmarks have successfully tested in other machine architectures,
such as ARM-V8 and RISC-V.

As a compiler, gcc is supported, but you may also try to use icc or clang.
For compiling, it is highly recommended to use gcc of version 4.3.0 or greater. 
For getting the best performance, changes in Makefile may be needed (compiler flags etc).
Important parameters for the benchmarks and/or library are set in the config.h file.


# Running Benchmarks

For running benchmarks use the bench.sh script file that is provided in the main directory of this source tree.

Example usage: `./bench.sh FILE.run OPTION1=NUM1  OPTION2=NUM2 ...`

To perform smoke test: `./run_all.sh`. This will quickly run all available benchmarks with default options
and store the results  in the file `results.txt`.

The following options are available:

|     Option          |                       Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `-t`, `--threads`  |  set the number of threads (fiber threads also included, if any) to be used in the benchmark |
|  `-f`, `--fibers`   |  set the number of user-level threads per posix thread |
|  `-c`, `--cores`    |  set the number of cores to be used by the benchmark |
|  `-r`, `--repeat`   |  set the number of times that the benchmark should be executed, default is 10 times |
|  `-w`, `--workload` |  set the amount of workload (i.e. dummy loop iterations among two consecutive operations of the  |benchmarked object), default is 64
|  `-l`, `--list`     |  displays the list of the available benchmarks |
|  `-b`, `--backoff`, `--backoff_high` |  set an upper backoff bound for lock-free and Sim-based algorithms |
|  `-bl`, `--backoff_low`  |  set a lower backoff bound (only for msqueue, lfstack and lfuobject benchmarks) |
|  `-h`, `--help`     |  displays this help and exits |

# Compiling the library

In case that you just want to compile the library that provides all the implemented concurrent algorithms
execute one of the following make commands. This step is not necessary in case that you want to run benchmarks.

|     Command             |                                Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  `make`                 |  Auto-detects the current architecture and compiles the library/benchmarks for it.   |
|  `make CC=cc ARCH=arch` |  Compiles the library/benchmarks for the current architecture using the cc compiler  |
|  `make icc`             |  Compiles the library/benchmarks using the icc compiler on some x86/x86_64 machine.  |
|  `make clean`           |  Cleaning-up all binary files.                                                       |

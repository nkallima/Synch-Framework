// This is a slightly modified version of the LCRQ queue implementation by Adam Morrison
// and Yehuda Afek provided in http://mcg.cs.tau.ac.il/projects/lcrq.
// LCRQ is presented in "Fast concurrent queues for x86 processors", by Adam Morrison,
// and Yehuda Afek, in PPoPP 2013.
// This modified version has some minor modifications in order to be compatible with the 
// latest version of the Synch framework.
// Notice that this algorithm performs exceptionally well in X86 machines that natively
// support 128-bit Compare&Swap instructions. It is also tested in ARM-V8 and in RISCV machines.
// This modified version seems to have very similar performance as the original one.
// The original version of LCRQ is distributed under the New BSD Licence (LGPL-2.1 is 
// compatible with New BSD Licence, more on https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-compatibility.html).
